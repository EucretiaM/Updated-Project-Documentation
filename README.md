Capturing stakeholder concerns and defining detailed functional/non functional requirements for my Math Booster system. 
THE MATH BOOSTER 
The system design is based on the Math Booster application that will help learners improve Maths marks in primary and high schools. 
I came up with an idea because of a great concern of poor Mathematics marks at primary school level and a drop out in Maths especially from grade 10 to grade 12.
The app will be web-based and app-based, and it will be hosted on a secure online server. The app will be accessed using secured registration and login using a third-party API. 
I am going to use MongoDB for my Database. I am going to include AI on my app to help learners to search for more infor about a certain question or Scenario. The real-time chart interface will be incorparated to allow learners to discuss about topics and assignments. 
The teachers will be the only admins. The app will allow teachers to anaylise the performances of the learners and recommendations will be made based of the learners' performance. 
The app will contain all Math Symbols and VS code editor or any easy to use editor to allow learners to make use of amazing interfaces.

HOW IT WORKS
Learners/Students and teachers will be allowed to register and log in. Teachers upload content and learners can complete the work/assignment and submit within the app.
The teacher(s) mark the work within the app and send back to the learner's profile. 
The teacher comments where necessary and the memo will be uploaded as soon as marking is done. 
Top learners will be displayed on the dashboard. The teacher can directley contact the learner using the app real-time chat, no WhatsApp allowed for the sake of learners safety and enforcing POPIA act.
